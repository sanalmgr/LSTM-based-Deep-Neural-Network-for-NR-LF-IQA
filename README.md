# LSTM-based-Deep-Neural-Network-for-NR-LF-IQA
In this work, we present a NR LF-IQA metric that is a Long Short-Term Memory based Deep Neural Network, named LSTMN-LFIQA. In this metric, we use CNN to extract primary features from LF images. Then we pass these features to LSTM network that learns long-term dependencies among quality-aware features. Furthermore, to overcome the problem of small size of input dataset, we demonstrate the efficiency of bottleneck features extracted from a pre-trained neural network for training process.

## Code
1. We generated EPIs using the method MultiEPL https://bit.ly/3Da8fB6
